# King County, WA Real Estate Analysis using Python and Tableau
### Utilizing Python for analysis and Tableau for visualization, I conduct an analysis of King County, WA home sale prices (2014-2015) to identify characteristics and trends that could potentially influence a homeâ€™s sale price. Attached are Jupyter Workbooks, as well as a link to a Tableau Dashboard with visualizations and recommendations.

## Background:
#### King County, Washington is one of the most densely populated counties in the United States of America. Due to this, real estate in this area is in high demand. In order to accurately price homes and maximize sales, real estate agents will need to understand the various factors that can influence profitability for their clients.

## Key Questions:
#### When it comes to assigning a home's value to prepare for sale, realtors might find themselves asking the following questions:
- Where are the highest valued homes within King County?
- When is it most advantageous for my clients to sell their home?
- How big of an impact does lot and home size have on sales price?
- Should my clients consider renovating their home to increase sales price?

## Data and Tools:
#### The data set was sourced via Kaggle and has been analyzed with Python. The project dashboard and visualizations have been created utilizing Tableau.
